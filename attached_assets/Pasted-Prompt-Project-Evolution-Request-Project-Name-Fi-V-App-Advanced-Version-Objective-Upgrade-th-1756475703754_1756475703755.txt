Prompt – Project Evolution Request

Project Name: Fi.V App – Advanced Version

Objective: Upgrade the existing platform with the following improvements:

1. Internationalization (i18n)

Translate the entire interface to Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).

Keep the structure ready to support future multi-language switching.

Update placeholders, system messages, and UI labels to Portuguese.

2. Advanced Reports Module

Enhance the Reports screen with:

Export options in PDF and Excel.

Summary of total conversations by period (daily, weekly, monthly).

Ranking of clients who opened the most tickets.

Agent performance metrics:

Number of resolved tickets.

Average response/closing time.

Future support for satisfaction rating (placeholder).

Comparison chart of conversation volume per queue/department.

3. Chatbot Configuration (Customizable Messages)

Create a dedicated section under Settings → Virtual Assistant:

Allow administrators to configure default system messages such as:

Greeting message (e.g., “Olá {{nome_cliente}}, seja bem-vindo à {{nome_empresa}}!”).

Department/Queue selection message (e.g., “Bem-vindo ao Suporte Técnico...”).

Closing message / Out-of-hours message.

Enable dynamic placeholders:

{{nome_cliente}} → Customer’s name.

{{nome_empresa}} → Company name.

{{protocolo}} → Ticket/protocol ID.

{{data_abertura}} → Ticket creation date.

Options to:

Enable/disable the chatbot.

Define response delay (in seconds).

4. Backoffice Layer (Administration Panel)

Implement a backoffice system for management and scalability:

Client Management: Register companies that will use the platform.

Plans & Billing: Manage subscriptions, invoices, and active plans.

Access Control: Define number of users per client, role-based permissions.

Multi-tenancy support: Each company should have its own instance/configuration automatically provisioned.

5. Other Adjustments

Maintain a modern, clean SPA architecture in React.

Keep UI consistent with current styling.

Use mock data for now, but ensure structure is ready for backend integration.

⚡ Deliverables for this iteration:

Full PT-BR translation.

Advanced reports screen (with export).

New Chatbot Settings screen.

Initial structure of Backoffice management system.
