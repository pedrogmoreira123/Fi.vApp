Prompt – Fi.V App (Frontend Focus)

Project Name: Fi.V App
Objective: Build the user interface (UI) of a modern, web-based, multi-user customer service platform for WhatsApp support.
The goal of this prompt is to design and develop all screens, UI components, and user interactions of the application. No backend logic or database connections should be implemented. The app must be built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React or Vue.

1. General Design & Theme

Style: Modern, clean, professional, and intuitive. Use proper spacing to avoid cluttered appearance.

Theme (Light & Dark):

The app must detect and apply the user’s OS theme automatically (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).

Users should also be able to manually switch between light/dark themes using a toggle button (in the header or profile settings).

Custom Branding:

The app name ("Fi.V App") should be replaceable with a company name defined in settings.

Admins must be able to configure a primary color and a secondary color, applied consistently to buttons, links, active icons, and other highlighted UI elements.

2. Core Layout

Main Layout:

Left: Fixed Sidebar Navigation.

Right: Main Content Area.
