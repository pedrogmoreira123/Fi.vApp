Technical Brief: Platform Enhancements & New Feature Implementation
Hello! Based on the latest application build, we have compiled the following list of required bug fixes, UI/UX enhancements, and new features. Reference images are attached for visual guidance.

1. Bug Fixes and Adjustments
1.1. Theme & Color System in /settings
Issue: The color customization functionality is not operational. User-selected colors are not being applied to global UI elements (buttons, links, backgrounds, etc.). Additionally, the RGB color picker component is not being triggered on click.

Action Required: Debug the script to ensure color changes are applied globally (either in real-time or upon saving). Ensure the color picker component is correctly instantiated and displayed on user interaction.

1.2. PDF Export Functionality Error
Issue: The PDF export feature is failing and throwing a [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] doc.autoTable is not a function error.

Action Required: Debug the report-export.tsx component at line 71. The autoTable function call is failing. Verify that the jspdf-autotable library is correctly imported and that the doc object is properly instantiated before the function is called.

2. UI/UX Enhancements and Refactoring
2.1. Refactor of Settings Screen (/settings)
Action Required: To simplify the UI, remove the following sections and their corresponding menu items from the settings page:

Responsive Layout

Profile

Security

Reference: image_30fda0.png (for the "Responsive Layout" section to be removed).

2.2. Menu Structure Refactoring
Action Required: Relocate the "Active Sessions" functionality. It should be moved from its current position and nested under the main "Reports" tab, appearing as a subsection or a specific report within that view.

2.3. Chat UI Redesign
Action Required:

Rebrand the "Conversas" tab label to "CHAT".

Implement a UI overhaul for the chat interface to match the modern layout shown in the reference image. The new design should feature a clear contact list on the left and the main conversation pane on the right.

3. New Feature Implementation
3.1. New "Tickets" Screen
Action Required: Implement a new primary screen named "Tickets".

Requirements:

The screen must feature tab-based filters to display tickets by status: Open, In Progress, Closed, Canceled, and All.

Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system for visibility:

Admin Role: Can view tickets from all users.

User Role: Can only view their own assigned tickets.

3.2. New "Clients" Module
Action Required: Create a new main tab in the side navigation menu labeled "Clients".

Requirements: This module will be dedicated to client management, allowing users to view, create, and edit contact information. The UI must be consistent with the existing system's design language.

3.3. Announcement Board and Notification Center
Action Required:

Implement a new tab in the side navigation menu labeled "Announcements". This section will allow admins to post system-wide communications.

Add a notification icon (bell) to the top-left corner of the main header. This icon must display a visual indicator (e.g., a red dot) for unread announcements. On click, it should trigger a dropdown or modal displaying recent announcements.

Thank you!
